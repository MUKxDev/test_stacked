## Getting Started

Use the build runner command before you run the application, adding new routes, or new services
- see the auth service for an example of a new service
- see the router.dart for how to add new routes

#### build_runner:

Use this command to generate build_runner code:

```
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

you can add it as an alias using the below command and then use `generate` insted.

```
alias generate="flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs"
```
